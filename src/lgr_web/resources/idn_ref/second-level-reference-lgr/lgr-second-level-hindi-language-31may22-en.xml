    <h1>Reference Label Generation Rules for the Hindi language</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This document specifies a reference set of Label Generation Rules (LGR) for the second level for the Hindi language written in the Devanagari script. 
     The starting point for the development of this LGR can be found in the related Root Zone LGR [RZ-LGR-Deva]. 
     The format of this file follows [RFC 7940].</p>  

     <p>For details and additional background on the script, see “Proposal for a Devanagari Script Root Zone Label Generation 
     Rule-Set (LGR)" [Proposal-Devanagari].</p>

<p class="notice">This document is a Review Draft and not final. Any version numbers shown are those of a possible future release. However, the draft may undergo significant revisions before any publication, or may be withdrawn.</p>

<h2>Repertoire</h2>
    <p>The repertoire contains 61 code points for letters for use in the Hindi language in addition to 11 sequences. 
      Most of these sequences have been defined in connection with the definition of variants with other scripts.
      (see  “Variants” below). The repertoire is a subset of [Unicode 11.0].
      For more details, see Section 5, “Repertoire” in [Proposal-Devanagari]).  
      (The proposal cited has been adopted for the Devanagari script portion of the Root Zone LGR.)</p>
    
      <p>For the second level, the repertoire has been augmented with the HYPHEN-MINUS, and two sets of decimal digits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>European (common) digits</li>
        <li>Devanagari digits</li>
    </ul>
    <p>for a total of 95 repertoire elements.</p>
    
      <p><b>Repertoire Listing:</b> Each code point or range is tagged with the script or scripts with which the code point is used,
      one or more tag values denoting character category, 
      and one or more references documenting sufficient justification for inclusion in the repertoire, see “References” below.
      For code points that are part of the repertoire, comments identify the languages using the code point.</p>
    
    <p>Code points   outside the Hindi language that are listed in this file are targets
        for out-of-repertoire variants and are identified by a reflexive (identity)
        variant of type “out-of-repertoire-var”. They do not form part of the
        repertoire.</p>

     <h2>Variants</h2>
     <p>This reference LGR is designed for use in zones shared by more than one script.
     Where appropriate, cross-script variants have been defined to mutually exclude labels
     from different scripts that could otherwise be substituted by the users. Once a label
     has been delegated for one script, any of its variant labels consisting entirely of cross-script variants would be
     blocked. Any label containing at least one code point that is not a cross-script variant
     would be considered distinct. Because of that, even large numbers of defined cross-script
     variants generally do not lead to a high percentage of labels experiencing a collision.</p>

    <p>This LGR defines in-script variants and cross-script variants as described in Section 6, “Variants”, in “[Proposal-Devanagari]”.
    The in-script variants are based on Candrabindu and Candra Vowel Signs followed by Anusvara plus digit variants.
    In addition to these, cross-script variants are defined with the Gurmukhi and Bengali scripts.</p>

    <p><b>Digit Variants:</b> All Devanagari digits are treated as semantic variants of the corresponding common (ASCII) digits. 
    By transitivity, they are also semantic variants of any native digits in scripts that also include the common digits.
    Such variant relations are deemed to exist implicitly by transitivity but are not listed explicitly in each reference LGR.
    (Omitting the listing of these other cross script digit variants does not affect index variant calculation, as the ASCII 
    digit variant being smallest would always be the index variant.)</p>
    
    <p>Note that in addition to a transitive semantic variant relation, Devanagari digits ZERO, TWO, FOUR, FIVE and EIGHT are 
    cross-script homoglyph or near homoglyph variants of the corresponding Gujarati digits. 
    Devanagari digit ZERO is a cross-script homoglyph or near homoglyph of digit ZERO in many other scripts; 
    these are already implicit semantic variants by transitivity and therefore not listed here.</p>
    
    <p>To keep digit variant sets manageable in zones where multiple scripts are present, no attempt has been made at identifying 
    cross-script variants among digits of different numeric value or between a digit in one script and a letter in another, 
    such as between digit zero and Latin letter ‘o’. Other mechanisms may be required to prevent homograph labels.</p>
   
    <p><b>Variant Disposition:</b> All variants are of type “blocked”; labels that 
    differ only by these variants are mutually exclusive: whichever label containing either of 
    these variants is chosen earlier would be delegated, while any other equivalent label should be blocked. There is no preference among these labels.</p>
    
    <p>This LGR does not define allocatable variants.</p> 
    
    <p><b>Context Rules for Variants:</b> some of the variants defined in this LGR are “effective null variants”, that is,
    some code points in the source map to “nothing” in the target with all other code points unchanged.
    (Because mappings are symmetric, it does not matter whether it is the forward or reverse mapping that
    maps to “null”). Such variants require a context rule to keep the variant set well behaved. Symmetry requires
    the same context rule for both forward and reverse mappings.</p>
   
    <p>In other cases, the sequences or code points making up source and target are constrained by explicit
    context rules on the code points (or by implicit context rules defined for the adjacent code points). 
     In such a case, any variants may require context rules that match the intersection
    between the effective contexts for both source and target; otherwise, a sequence might be considered valid in some
    variant label when it would not be valid in an equivalent context in an original label.</p>
    
   <p>The specification of variants in this reference LGR follows the guidelines in [RFC 8228].</p>

    <h2>Character Classes</h2>
    <p>Devanagari is an alphasyllabary and the heart of the writing system is 
    the <em>akshar</em>. This is the unit which is instinctively recognized by users of the script.
    As encoded, the writing system of Devanagari is composed of Consonants, Halant, Vowels, Anusvara, Candrabindu, Nukta and Visarga.</p>
    
    <p><b>Consonants:</b> Devanagari consonants all contain an implicit schwa /ə/. 
    To make a full syllable, consonants may be followed by certain code points from one or more 
    of the other groups (see “WLE rules” below). See Section 3.3.1, “The Consonants” in [Proposal-Devanagari].</p>
    
    <p><b>Halant:</b> Because   all consonants contain an implicit vowel /ə/,
    a special sign is needed to denote that this implicit vowel is stripped off. 
    This sign is the Halant, encoded as U+094D ( ् ) DEVANAGARI SIGN VIRAMA. The Halant thus joins two consonants and 
    creates conjuncts, which can be generally from 2 to 4 consonant combinations. 
    In rare cases, it can join up to 5 consonants. However, this LGR will not enforce any length limit.

    See Section 3.3.2, “The Implicit Vowel Killer: Halant” in [Proposal-Devanagari].</p>

    <p><b>Vowels and Matras:</b> There are separate code points for vowels that are pronounced 
    independently  at the beginning of a syllable or after a vowel sound. To indicate 
    a vowel sound following a consonant other than the implicit shwa sound, a vowel sign (matra) is 
    attached to the consonant. There is an equivalent matra for each vowel excepting U+0905 ( अ ) DEVANAGARI VOWEL A.  
    See Section 3.3.3, “Vowels” in [Proposal-Devanagari].</p>
    
    <p><b>Anusvara:</b> The Anusvara shows a nasal at  the end of a syllable. See Section 3.3.4, “The Anusvara” of the [Proposal-Devanagari].</p>
    
    <p><b>Candrabindu:</b> A Candrabindu denotes nasalization of the preceding vowel. Present-day 
    Hindi users tend to replace the Candrabindu by the Anusvara. 
    See Section 3.3.5, “Nasalization: Candrabindu” in [Proposal-Devanagari].</p>
    
    <p><b>Nukta:</b> The nukta sign is placed below a certain number of consonants 
    to represent sounds found only in words borrowed from Perso-Arabic, English and other non-Aryan sources. 
    It is also placed under the consonants U+0921 ( ड ) and U+0922 ( ढ ) to indicate 
    flapped sounds. 
    See Section 3.3.6, “Nukta” in [Proposal-Devanagari].</p>

    <p><b>Visarga:</b> U+0903 ( ः ) DEVANAGARI SIGN VISARGA, representing an aspiration at the end of a syllable, is 
    frequently used in Sanskrit. See Section 3.3.7, “Visarga and Avagraha” in [Proposal-Devanagari].</p>

    <p><b>Devanagari Digits:</b> U+0966 to U+096F are a set of Devanagari-specific digits. They are used in alternation with the European (common) digits.</p>

    <p><b>Common Digits:</b> U+0030 to U+0039 are the set of digits from the ASCII range. </p>

    <h2>Whole Label Evaluation (WLE) and Context Rules</h2>
    <h3>Common Rules</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Hyphen Restrictions</b> &mdash; restrictions on the allowable placement of hyphens (no leading/ending hyphen
             and no hyphen in positions 3 and 4). These restrictions are described in Section 4.2.3.1 of RFC 5891 [150]. 
             They are implemented here as context rule on U+002D (-) HYPHEN-MINUS.</li>
          <li><b>Leading Combining Marks</b>   &mdash;  restrictions on the allowable placement of combining marks
             (no leading combining mark). This rule is described in Section 4.2.3.2 of RFC 5891 [150].</li>
          <li><b>Digit-mixing</b> &mdash; no mixing between different digit sets (European and Devanagari digits)
             is allowed; implemented here as a WLE rule with associated action.</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Default Actions</h3>
    <p>This LGR includes the default actions for LGRs as well as the action needed to
        invalidate labels with misplaced combining marks. They are marked with &#x235F;.
        For a description see [RFC 7940].</p> 
        
    <h3>Hindi-specific Rules</h3>
    <p>These rules ensure that the Hindi label conforms
    to akshar formation norms for the Devanagari script.  These norms are exclusively 
    presented as context rules.</p>
    <p>The following symbols are used in the names and comments for WLE rules: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>C    &#x2192;    Consonant</li>
      <li>M    &#x2192;    Matra</li>
      <li>V    &#x2192;    Vowel</li>
      <li>B    &#x2192;    Anusvara (Bindu)</li> 
      <li>D    &#x2192;    Candrabindu</li>
      <li>X    &#x2192;    Visarga</li>
      <li>H    &#x2192;    Halant / Virama</li>
      <li>N    &#x2192;    Nukta</li>
      </ul>
    
    <p>The rules are: </p>
     <ul>
     <li>1.    N: must be preceded by C1</li>
     <li>2.    H: must be preceded by C or CN</li>
     <li>3.    M: must be preceded by C or CN</li>
     <li>4.    X: must be preceded by any of V, C, N or M</li>
     <li>5.    B: must be preceded by any of V, C, N or M </li>
     <li>6.    D: must be preceded by any of V, C, N or M </li>
     <li>7.    V: Can NOT be preceded by H </li>
     </ul> 
     <p>See Section 7, “Whole Label Evaluation Rules (WLE)” in [Proposal-Devanagari].</p>
     
    <p>Hindi labels may use either Devanagari or ASCII digits but not a mixture.</p>
    
    <h2>Methodology and Contributors</h2>
    <p>This reference LGR for the Hindi language for the second level has been developed by Michel Suignard and Asmus Freytag, based on the Root Zone LGR for the Devanagari script
     script and information contained or referenced therein, see [RZ-LGR-Deva]. Suitable extensions for the second level have been applied according to the [Guidelines] and with community input. 
     The original proposal for a Root Zone LGR for the Devanagari script, that this reference LGR is based on, was developed by the Neo-Brahmi Generation Panel (NBGP).
     For more information on methodology and contributors to the underlying Root Zone LGR, 
     see Sections 4 and 8 in [Proposal-Devanagari], as well as [RZ-LGR-Overview].</p>
