        <h1>Reference Label Generation Rules for the Khmer Script</h1>
        
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This document specifies a reference set of Label Generation Rules (LGR) for the Khmer script for the second level. 
          The starting point for the development of this LGR can be found in the related Root Zone LGR [RZ-LGR-4-Khmr]. 
          For details and additional background on the script  see "Proposal for a Khmer Script Root Zone LGR [Proposal-Khmer]".
          The format of this file follows [RFC 7940].</p>

       <h2>Repertoire</h2>
        <p>The repertoire contains 71 code points for letters used for writing languages in the Khmer script; in addition, 
        two Khmer subscript    consonant sequences have been defined. The repertoire         only includes code points used by 
        languages that are actively written in the Khmer script. The repertoire is a subset of [Unicode 6.3].
        For details, see Section 5, "Repertoire" in [Proposal-Khmer]. 
         (The proposal cited has been adopted for the Khmer script portion of the Root Zone LGR.)</p>
    
         <p>For the second level, the repertoire has been augmented with the ASCII digits, U+0030 to U+0039, and U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS 
         for a total of 94 repertoire elements.</p>

        <p>Each code point or range is tagged with the script or scripts that the code point is used with, one or more categories, and one or more 
        references documenting sufficient justification for inclusion in the repertoire, see "References" below.</p>

       <h2>Variants</h2>
        <p>This LGR defines two Khmer consonants as variants of each other 
          in their subscript form only. This is captured by a variant relation between the two subscript sequences, 
          which are listed explicitly in the repertoire. See Section 6, "Variants" in [Proposal-Khmer],</p>
          
         <p><b>Digit Variants:</b> All Khmer digits are treated as semantic variants of the corresponding common (ASCII) digits. 
        By transitivity, they are also semantic variants of any native digits in scripts that also include the common digits.
        Such transitive relations are deemed to exist implicitly but are not listed explicitly in each reference LGR.
        (Omitting the listing of these other cross script digit variants does not affect index variant calculation, as the ASCII 
        digit variant being smallest would always be the index variant.)
        There is a strong resemblance between Thai and Khmer digits, and certain Lao digits. In addition,
        Khmer digit ZERO is a cross-script homoglyph or near homoglyph of digit ZERO in many other scripts; 
        all of these are already implicit semantic variants by transitivity and therefore not listed here. 
        To keep digit variant sets manageable in zones where multiple scripts are present, no attempt has been made at identifying 
        cross-script variants among digits of <em>different numeric value</em> or between a digit in one script and a letter in another, 
        such as between digit zero and Latin letter 'o'. Other mechanisms may be required to prevent homograph labels.</p>
        
        <p><b>Variant Disposition:</b> All variants are of type "blocked", making labels that 
        differ only by these variants mutually exclusive: whichever label containing either of 
        these variants is chosen earlier would be delegated, while any other equivalent label should be blocked.</p>
    
      <p>This LGR does not define allocatable variants.</p>

       <p>The specification of variants in this reference LGR follows the guidelines in [RFC 8228].</p>
          
        <h2>Character Classes</h2>
        <p><b>Consonants:</b> When more than one consonant occur together in the onset of a grapheme cluster, the additional consonants are written in subscript form, 
        joined with the first consonant in the sequence. In Unicode, this is indicated by preceding each additional consonant with U+17D2 (្) KHMER SIGN COENG. 
        Some consonants have been given the tag "base-only"; these do not take subscript form. Consonants can have light or strong pronunciation indicated by
        two shifter signs; additionally there are six signs for phonological modifications as discussed below. See Section 5.2, "Consonants" in [Proposal-Khmer].</p>
        
         <p><b>Independent vowels:</b> These occur independently and cannot combine with any of the marks including dependent vowels and sign. The use of a 
         subscript    form, while defined in Unicode, is not supported here. See Section 5.2, "Independent Vowels" in [Proposal-Khmer].</p>
         
          <p><b>Dependent vowels:</b> The 16 dependent vowels included in the Khmer LGR have been further classified into three subcategories namely 
          dependent vowel 1, dependent vowel 2 and dependent vowel 3, see below. Dependent vowels must follow a consonant, shifter or the Robat sign. 
          They cannot occur independently. See Section 5.3, "Dependent Vowels" in [Proposal-Khmer].</p>
          
        <p><b>Shifters:</b> the character U+17C9 (៉) KHMER SIGN MUUSIKATOAN is used with a subset of <i>first series</i> consonants, 
          code points from this subset have been given the tag "series-one". The character U+17CA (៊) KHMER SIGN TRIISAP is used with subset of <i>second series</i> consonants 
          and with U+1794 (ប) KHMER LETTER BA. Code points from this subset have been given the tag "series-two". The two characters are collectively known as 
          consonant shifters and have been given the tag "shifter". See Section 5.5, "Shifters" in [Proposal-Khmer] and reference [210].</p>
          
        <p><b>Robat:</b> The character U+17CC (៌) KHMER SIGN ROBAT has been given the tag "robat". It follows consonants but unlike other signs may be followed by a
          dependent vowel. See Sections 5.3, "Dependent Vowels" and 5.4, "Signs" in [Proposal-Khmer].</p>
          
         <p><b>Signs (Bantoc):</b> The character 
          U+17CB (់) KHMER SIGN BANTOC is used with a subset of consonants, that subset has been given the tag 
          "series-three", see Section 5.4, "Signs" in [Proposal-Khmer] and reference [205].</p>
          
         <p><b>Signs (Yuukalepintu and Samyoksannya):</b> 
          The character U+17C8 (្) KHMER SIGN YUUKALEAPINTU is written after a consonant to indicate that it is to be followed by a short vowel and a glottal stop. 
           The sign is used with all the consonants. The character U+17D0 (្) KHMER SIGN SAMYOKSANNYA is written above a consonant or a shifter to indicate that the 
           syllable contains a particular short vowel. The sign is used with all the consonants or all the shifters. See Section 5.4, "Signs" in [Proposal-Khmer].</p>

        <p><b>Signs (Nikahit and Reahmuk):</b> The character U+17C6 (ំ) KHMER SIGN NIKAHIT is used with consonants and some dependent vowels. 
          These dependent vowels have been given a tag "dependent-vowel-1" (see Sections 5.3 and 5.4 in [Proposal-Khmer]). 
          The character U+17C7 (ះ) KHMER SIGN REAHMUK is used with consonants and some dependent vowels. 
          These dependent vowels have been given a tag "dependent-vowel-2" (see Sections 5.3 and 5.4 in [Proposal-Khmer]). </p>
          
          <p><b>Signs (Toandakhiat):</b> The sign ្ KHMER SIGN TOANDAKHIAT (U+17CD) is written over a final consonant to indicate that it is unpronounced. 
          It is used with all consonants or Khmer vowel SIGN I (U+17B7). The latter has been given a tag "dependent-vowel-3". See Section 5.4, "Signs" in [Proposal-Khmer].</p>

       <p><b>Khmer Digits:</b> U+17E0 to U+17E9 are a set of Khmer-specific digits. They are used in alternation with the European (common) digits.</p>

       <p><b>Common Digits:</b> U+0030 to U+0039 are the set of digits from the ASCII range. </p>
        
        <h2>Whole Label Evaluation (WLE) and Context Rules</h2>
        <h3>Common Rules</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Hyphen Restrictions</b> &mdash; restrictions on the allowable placement of hyphens (no leading/ending hyphen
             and no hyphen in positions 3 and 4). These restrictions are described in section 4.2.3.1 of RFC 5891 [150]. 
             They are implemented here as context rule on U+002D (-) HYPHEN-MINUS.</li>
          <li><b>Leading Combining Marks</b>   &mdash;  restrictions on the allowable placement of combining marks
             (no leading combining mark). This rule is described in section 4.2.3.2 of RFC 5891 [150].</li>
          <li><b>Digit-mixing</b> &mdash; no mixing between different digit sets (European and Khmer digits)
             is allowed; implemented here as a WLE rule with associated action.</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>
        Default Actions</h3> 
        <p>Actions include the default actions for LGRs as well as that needed to
        invalidate labels with misplaced combining marks. They are marked with &#x235F;.
        For a description see [RFC 7940].</p>
          
        <h3>Khmer-specific Rules and Action</h3>
        <p>Rules provided in the LGR as described in Section 7 of [Proposal-Khmer] constrain possible labels 
          so that they reasonably conform to Khmer syllable structure. These constraints are presented as context 
          rules on the affected code points, except for the whole-label rule and associated
           action that enforce the limit on the number of consecutive subscripted consonants. </p>
          
        <p>The rules are: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Subscript-consonant</b> &mdash; A rule that specifies allowable consonant sequence. See Section 7.2 in [Proposal-Khmer]</li>
          <li><b>Subscript-consonant-limit</b> &mdash; A rule that limits the occurrence of subscript-consonant to two. In case of three, the associate action gives the label the disposition invalid.  See Section 7.3 in [Proposal-Khmer]</li>
          <li><b>Coeng-context</b> &mdash; A context rule for 17D2 that requires a consonant before it and a consonant other than base-only after it. See Section 7.4 in [Proposal-Khmer]</li>
          <li><b>Follows-consonant-robat-shifter</b> &mdash;  A context rule for those code points that must follow a consonant, robat or shifter. See Section 7.5 in [Proposal-Khmer]</li>
          <li><b>Follows-series-two</b> &mdash;  A context rule for those code points that must follow series-two consonants. See Section 7.6 in [Proposal-Khmer]</li>
          <li><b>Follows-series-one</b> &mdash; A context rule for those code points that must follow series-one consonants. See Section 7.7 in [Proposal-Khmer]</li>
          <li><b>Follows-consonant</b> &mdash; A context rule for those code points that must always follow a consonant. See Section 7.8 in [Proposal-Khmer]</li>
          <li><b>Follows-consonant-shifter</b> A context rule for those code points that must always follow a consonant or shifter. See Section 7.9 in [Proposal-Khmer]</li>
          <li><b>Follows-consonant-depvowel-1-shifter</b> &mdash; A context rule for those code points that must follow consonant, shifter or dependent-vowel-1. See Section 7.10 in [Proposal-Khmer]</li>
          <li><b>Follows-consonant-depvowel-2-shifter</b> &mdash; A context rule for those code points that must follow consonant, shifter or dependent-vowel-2. See Section 7.11 in [Proposal-Khmer]</li>
          <li><b>Follows-series-three</b> &mdash; A context rule for those code points that must follow series-three consonants. See Section 7.12 in [Proposal-Khmer]</li>
          <li><b>Follows-consonant-or-vowel-i</b> &mdash; A context rule for those code points that must follow a consonant or 17B7 KHMER VOWEL SIGN I. See Section 7.13 in [Proposal-Khmer]</li>
        </ul>

         <h2>Methodology and Contributors</h2>
        <p>This reference LGR for Khmer for the 2nd Level has been developed by Michel Suignard and Asmus Freytag, based on the Root Zone LGR for Khmer 
    and information contained or referenced therein, see [RZ-LGR-4-Khmr]. Suitable extensions for the second level have been applied according to the [Guidelines]. 
    The original proposal for a Root Zone LGR for the Khmer script, that this reference LGR is based on, was developed by the Khmer Generation Panel. 
    For more information on methodology and contributors to the underlying Root Zone LGR, see Sections 4 and 8 in [Proposal-Khmer], as well as [RZ-LGR-Overview].</p>
