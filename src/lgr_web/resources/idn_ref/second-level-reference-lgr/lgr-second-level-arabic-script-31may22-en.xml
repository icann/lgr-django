      <h1>Reference Label Generation Rules for the Arabic Script</h1>
       
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This document specifies a reference set of Label Generation Rules (LGR) for the Arabic script for the second level. 
       The starting point for the development of this LGR can be found in the related Root Zone LGR [RZ-LGR-Arab]. 
       The format of this file follows [RFC 7940].</p>
       
       <p>For details and additional background on the script, see TF-AIDN, “Proposal for Arabic Script Root Zone LGR”, Version 3.4, 18 November 2015 [Proposal-Arabic].
       Additional work was done by a TF-AIDN group to create extensions appropriate to the second level and these are incorporated in this LGR. (See “Methodology” below).
      </p>

    <p>The document contains certain provisions for customization. (See “Customizing actions for International Reachability” below.)</p>
         
      <p class="notice">This document is a Review Draft and not final. Any version numbers shown are those of a possible future release. However, the draft may undergo significant revisions before any publication, or may be withdrawn.</p>

    <h2>Repertoire</h2> 
    <p>The repertoire includes    the 128 code points for letters used by languages that are actively written in the 
     Arabic script as described in Section 3.2 of [Proposal-Arabic]. 
     For the second level, the repertoire has been augmented with the HYPHEN-MINUS, and three sets of decimal digits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>European (common) digits</li>
        <li>Arabic-Indic digits</li>
        <li>Extended Arabic-Indic digits</li>
    </ul>
    <p>for a total of 159 repertoire elements.</p>
    
    <p>The repertoire excludes code points for which TF-AIDN was unable to find sufficient evidence of use (see Appendix F in [Proposal-Arabic]). 
    The repertoire is described in Section 3.2 of [Proposal-Arabic] and a subset of [Unicode 11.0].</p>
      
      <p>This LGR does not include combining marks or code point sequences. All combining marks have been 
      excluded for these reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First, they can significantly overproduce and would require additional rules to contain them effectively, 
        complicating the design.</li>
        <li>Second, even where they are required for some languages, they are optional for others. </li>
        <li>Third, this also circumvents the issue regarding duplication between some precomposed code points and combining sequences raised by [IAB].</li>
      </ul>  
       
      <p>For further details, see Section 3.2, “Code point repertoire included” in [Proposal-Arabic]. 
    (The proposal cited has been adopted for the Arabic script portion of the Root Zone LGR.)</p>

      <p><b>Repertoire Listing:</b> Each code point or range is tagged with the script or scripts with which the code point is used, and one or more 
      references documenting sufficient justification for inclusion in the repertoire, see “References” below.
      Comments identify the principal languages or orthographies using the code point. Languages are given with their [EGIDS] level;
      use of standard Arabic code points by other languages is not marked.</p>

    <h3>Correlation Between Repertoire and Bidi Rules</h3>
    <p>Because this LGR contains only a subset of PVALID code points, the Bidi rules expressed in Section 2 of RFC 5893 [160] (Bidi Rule) can be simplified to two constraints:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Prevent digits (whether European, Arabic-Indic, or Extended-Arabic-Indic) from starting a label.</li>
        <li>In any label, allow only digits from one the sets (whether European, Arabic-Indic, or Extended-Arabic-Indic) .</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Variants</h2>
     <p>This reference LGR is designed for use in zones shared by more than one script.
     Where appropriate, cross-script variants have been defined to mutually exclude labels
     from different scripts that could otherwise be substituted by the users. Once a label
     has been delegated for one script, any of its variant labels consisting entirely of cross-script variants would be
     blocked. Any label containing at least one code point that is not a cross-script variant
     would be considered distinct. Because of that, even large numbers of defined cross-script
     variants generally do not lead to a high percentage of labels experiencing a collision.</p>

    <p><b>Digit Variants:</b> The two sets of Arabic-specific digits are treated as semantic variants of each other 
       and of the corresponding common (ASCII) digits.
       
       By transitivity, they are also semantic variants of any native digits in scripts that also include the common digits.
       Because of the restriction on leading digits, most labels would contain a unique code point in addition 
       to any digits, thus no variant labels would actually result from any pro-forma cross-script variants.</p>
       
      <p>To keep digit variant sets manageable in zones where multiple scripts are present, no attempt has been made at identifying 
       cross-script variants among digits of different numeric value or between a digit in one script and a letter in another, 
       such as between digit zero and Latin letter ‘o’.</p>

      <p><b>Variant Disposition:</b> This LGR includes “blocked” and “allocatable” variants, assigned according to Section 4, 
      “Final recommendation of variants for Top Level Domains (TLDs)” in [Proposal-Arabic]. 
      These recommendations balance the desire to minimize the number of possible allocatable variants with the need to keep the
      definition of variants simple. See also the comments given in the listing.</p> 

      <p>For the second level, three additional variant types are added:  “optionally-allocatable”, “activated”, and “optionally-activated”.
      They are used to improve user acceptance. The rationale for these new types is provided below.</p>

   <h3>Methodology for Defining Variants</h3>

    <p>In generating the variant tables, a number of concepts have been used:</p>
    <ul style="list-style: lower-latin;">

    <li><p>One of the main principles for the stability of the Internet and IDNs is that the end user
         should be able to reach a website connected to his/her domain name regardless of location.
         Additionally, an end user reads and types website addresses based on his/her language alphabet
         and whatever is available in his/her keyboard. Therefore, in order to enforce this principle
         the input devices (language table) that the user may use to reach a domain name (based on the
         user location) should be carefully considered when defining variants. Otherwise, it may cause
         a reachability problem and reduce the user acceptance. For example, if someone registered the
         domain name “مكة” (all characters from the Arabic language) and a user try to reach the website
         connected to this  domain name from an Internet café or airport, say, in Pakistan. He/she will
         not be able to reach that website unless if the variant “مکۃ” (Urdu variant) is already allocated
         and activated. Thus, variants need to be studied from both similarity point of view (by language
         community) and reachability pointy of view (based on input devices used by other language
         communities).</p></li>
    <li><p>Consistency is a very important concept in generating variants. Regardless of the selected
         applied-for label the list of generated allocatable variants should be the same. As we are dealing
         with normal users at the SLD, their 1st choice (applied-for) label might not be the one that
         will be used by the internet community. Therefore, a registry should provide the registrant the
         ability to “correct” his/her choice if he/she was not successful with the first try. For example,
         the word “Internet” is written in most Arab countries in North Africa as (أنترنت) while it is
         written in other Arab countries as (إنترنت), while end users often write it as (انترنت).
         Therefore, if someone registered “أنترنت”, he/she should be able to enable “إنترنت” or “انترنت”.
         Additionally, many words have two correct ways to write them, for example, both “آدم” and “أدم” are
         widely used for the same name Adam. Hence, if someone registered “أدم” he/she should be able to
         enable “آدم” or “ادم”. This is achieved by making variants allocatable in at least one direction in the
         LGR.</p></li>

    <li><p>Based on the principle expressed in the previous item, some code points are involved in at least one variant mapping of type
         “activated”, “optionally-activated”, or “optionally-allocatable. The dispositions related to these mappings
         may be optionally modified by a registry by editing the appropriate action elements.
         See the section on “Customizing Actions for International Reachability” for details of how this
         feature can be made mandatory or disabled.</p></li>
    </ul>

       <p>The specification of variants in this reference LGR follows the guidelines in [RFC 8228].</p>

      <h2>Character Classes</h2>
    <p>This proposal defines the following named character classes:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>common-digits</b> &mdash; ASCII digits: U+0030 to U+0039</li>
    <li><b>arabic-indic-digits</b> &mdash; Arabic-Indic digits used with Arabic: U+0660 to U+0669</li>
    <li><b>extended arabic-indic-digits</b> &mdash; Arabic-Indic digits used with other languages: U+06F0 to U+06F9</li>
     </ul>

      <h2>Whole Label Evaluation (WLE) and Context Rules</h2>
      <h3>Common Rules</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Hyphen Restrictions</b> &mdash; restrictions on the allowable placement of hyphens (no leading/ending hyphen
             and no hyphen in positions 3 and 4). These restrictions are described in Section 4.2.3.1 of RFC 5891 [150]. 
             They are implemented here as context rule on U+002D (-) HYPHEN-MINUS.</li>
          <li><b>Leading Combining Marks</b>   &mdash;  restrictions on the allowable placement of combining marks
             (no leading combining mark). This rule is described in Section 4.2.3.2 of RFC 5891 [150].</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Right-To-Left Rules</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>leading-digit</b> &mdash; RFC 5893 [160] restrictions on the allowable placement of digits (no leading digit), see section 2.1; 
         implemented here as a context rule on each digit.</li>
        <li><b>digit-mixing</b> &mdash; no mixing between different digit sets (European, Arabic-Indic, and Extended-Arabic-Indic digits) 
        is allowed (see section 2.4 of RFC 5893 [160]); implemented here as a WLE rule with associated action.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Default Actions</h3>
      <p>This LGR includes the default actions for LGRs as well as the action needed to
        invalidate labels with misplaced combining marks. They are marked with &#x235F;.
        For a description see [RFC 7940].</p> 

      <h3>Arabic-specific Rules</h3>
    <p>The following rules aim at reducing the allocation of redundant labels. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>No connected ALEF MAKSURA in the Arabic language &mdash; restriction on having ALEF MAKSURA (0649) before a right joining
         or dual joining code point.</li>
        <li>Restricting language mixing in the generated variants &mdash; restriction on mixing code points from different languages using the Arabic scripts.
          This is implemented by not mixing the first group of letters (U+0629, U+0643, U+0647, and U+0649) mostly used only in the Arabic language, with a second group of letters
          (U+06A9, U+06AA, U+06BE, U+06C1, U+06C2, U+06C3, and U+06CC) not commonly used in the Arabic language.</li>
    </ul>
    
      <p>In addition, this LGR includes WLE rules and actions specific to the Arabic script found in Section 5, “Whole Label Evaluation (WLE) rules” in [Proposal-Arabic]. 
      As specified, the rules and actions serve to prevent the mixing of two variants of the same code point within the same label. This reduces overproduction
      of variant labels. The rules are listed here with the numbers given in Table 17 in [Proposal-Arabic]. See also the comments given for each rule or action.
      Note that that WLE Rules 1, 2, 3, and 8 part of that Table 17 are omitted here because they are superseded by the rule restricting language mixing described above.</p> 
      <ul>
        <li><b>no-mix-heh-goal</b> &mdash; WLE Rule 4: do not mix Arabic letters HEH and HEH GOAL in the same label</li>
        <li><b>no-mix-heh-goal-ae</b> &mdash; WLE Rule 5: do not mix Arabic letters HEH GOAL and AE in the same label</li>
        <li><b>no-mix-heh-ae</b> &mdash; WLE Rule 6: do not mix Arabic letters HEH and AE in the same label</li>
        <li><b>no-mix-heh-doachashmee</b> &mdash; WLE Rule 7: do not mix Arabic letters HEH and HEH DOACHASHMEE in the same label</li>
        <li><b>no-mix-noon-with-three-dots-above-yeh-with-three-dots-below</b> &mdash; WLE Rule 9: do not mix Arabic letters NOON WITH THREE DOTS ABOVE and YEH WITH THREE DOTS BELOW in the same label</li>
        <li><b>no-mix-peh-noon-with-three-dots-above</b> &mdash; WLE Rule 10: do not mix Arabic letters PEH and NOON WITH THREE DOTS ABOVE in the same label</li>
        <li><b>no-mix-feh-with-dot-moved-below</b> &mdash; WLE Rule 11:do not mix Arabic letters FEH and FEH WITH DOT MOVED BELOW in the same label</li>
        <li><b>no-mix-qaf-with-dot-above</b> &mdash; WLE Rule 12: do not mix Arabic letters QAF and QAF WITH DOT ABOVE in the same label</li>
        <li><b>no-mix-feh-qaf-with-dot-above</b> &mdash; WLE Rule 13: do not mix Arabic letters FEH and QAF WITH DOT ABOVE in the same label</li>
        <li><b>no-mix-kaf-with-ring-gaf</b> &mdash; WLE Rule 14: do not mix Arabic letters KAF WITH RING and GAF in the same label</li>
        <li><b>no-mix-kaf-with-ring-keheh-with-three-dots-above</b> &mdash; WLE Rule 15: do not mix Arabic letters KAF WITH RING and KEHEH WITH THREE DOTS ABOVE</li>
        <li><b>no-mix-gaf-keheh-with-three-dots-above</b> &mdash; WLE Rule 16: do not mix Arabic letters GAF and KEHEH WITH THREE DOTS ABOVE in the same label</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Arabic Script-specific Actions</h3>
    <p>The three non-default variant mapping types used in this reference LGR trigger actions that result in variant label dispositions as follows:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>if at least one variant is in {activated}, force delegation,</li>
    <li>if at least one variant is in {optionally-activated}, by default the label is allocatable, but the LGR 
        can be  customized to force delegation for these variant labels by selecting a different disposition in the corresponding action,</li>
    <li>if at least one variant is in {optionally-allocatable}, by default the label is blocked, but the LGR 
        can be  customized to make the variant label allocatable instead, by selecting a different disposition in the corresponding action.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Variant mappings of type “activated” lead to a disposition of “activated”, which implies means the variant label should be allocated.
    This variant type is used here for the variant mappings between the three sets of digits.
    Activated variants are handled by the first action above, and are not affected by the optional customizations described below.</p>

   <h3>Customizing Actions for International Reachability</h3>
    <p>As described above, this LGR is designed so that full “international reachability” is optionally available. It can easily be enabled
      with a small customization.</p>

    <p>The disposition for the second of the actions listed above is by default set to “allocatable” which makes the variant available to registrants 
    that would like to support international reachability. Some registry operators may desire to make support for such variants
    mandatory, in which case the disposition (disp=“allocatable” in the XML) for the relevant action could be changed from “allocatable” to “activated” 
    without further changes to the LGR.</p>
    
    <p>The disposition for the last of the actions listed above is by default set to “blocked” which reserves the variants of type “optionally-allocatable”.
     Some registry operators may desire to support such variants as allocatable, in which case the disposition (disp=“blocked” in the XML) for the 
     relevant action could be changed from “blocked” to “allocatable” without further changes to the LGR.</p>
     
    <p>Most of the code points involved in labels resulting in “activated” or “allocatable” actions are subject to “no-mix” rules
     to decrease the number of activated or allocatable variants. This is especially a concern for the “activated” action which results
     in forced delegation.</p>
     
    <p>If optional variant labels are all made allocatable, a significantly large number of allocatable variant labels
     can potentially be created. Keeping the allocatable variant labels manageable is advised by SSAC in their [SAC060] report.
     One way to contain such variant labels, as suggested by the Arabic script community, is to allow only the variant labels
     which are usable and still block those which may be redundant, e.g. cannot be typed from a single keyboard supporting a given language.
     For this purpose, the no language mixing rule is part of this LGR.</p>
         
    <p>Furthermore, applying this customization for variant sets involving code points which do not have “no-mix” should be done with caution.
     This is especially true for the variant set including the ALEF characters, for which an external policy should be established to ensure
     that only a strictly limited number of variant labels are allocated. It may not be possible to create a general policy that determine
     which of the variants from among a potential large variant pool are indeed suitable; therefore, the selection may have to be left as a choice to
     the registrant, but within a strict cap.</p>

      <h2>Methodology and Contributors</h2>
      <p>This reference LGR for Arabic script for the second level has been edited by Michel Suignard and Asmus Freytag, based on extensive community input.
       This LGR is based on the Root Zone LGR for Arabic and relies on information contained or referenced therein, see [RZ-LGR-Arab]. 
       Suitable extensions for the second level have been applied according to the [Guidelines] and with community input. 
       The  original proposal for an Arabic Script Root Zone LGR [Proposal-Arabic] that this LGR is based on, was developed by the Task Force for Arabic Script IDNs [TF-AIDN].
       The specific features related to the International Reachability aspect were drafted by a TF-AIDN sub-group (namely in alphabetical order: Abdalmonem Tharwat Galila, Abdeslam Nasri,
       Abdulaziz Al-Zoman, Abdulrahman Alghadir, Hazem Hezzah, Nabil Benamar, Raed Alfayez, Tarik Merghani). In addition, Sarmad Hussain provided editorial support.</p>
      <p>For more information on methodology and contributors to the underlying Root Zone LGR, see [Proposal-Arabic], as well as [RZ-LGR-Overview].</p> 
     <h3>Changes from Version 1</h3>
     <p>The formulation of the no-mix rule for languages in Version 1 was found to be defective and has been corrected. Without the correction, the LGR
     would disallow labels with characters from the common subset (those neither in group 1 or group 2). The result of the fix is to allow such labels
     as expected, while continuing to prohibit labels containing code points from both group 1 and group 2 in the same label.
     </p>
     <h3>Changes from Version 2</h3><p>Unicode Version has been updated.</p>
