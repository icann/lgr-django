            <p>
            <p>Each element LGR represents in full the underlying, proposal for the script-based LGR, except for 
            changes required by the integration process or for uniformity of presentation. 
            See Section 3, "Integration and Contents of LGR-3" in [LGR-3].</p>
            
            <h2>Merged LGR</h2>
            <p>This merged LGR contains the union of the repertoire, variant mappings and Whole
            Label Evaluation (WLE) rules as described in the following sections. Data that are necessarily
            script-dependent, such as the type for variant mappings have been removed or replaced by
            default values.</p>
            
            <p>When processing an applied for label, this merged LGR presents the complete data and
            specification needed for conflict checking with any existing label, independent of script, while each
            script-specific element LGR presents the complete data and specification to determine the validity
            and full set of allocatable variants for the label, when applied for under that script. See also Section 5,
             "Using the LGR" in [LGR-3].</p>
            
            <h2>Repertoire</h2> 
            <p>The repertoire of the integrated Root Zone LGR is the cumulative repertoire of all the Element 
            LGRs that have been integrated into this version. Those repertoires, in turn were
            developed based on [MSR-4], which is a subset of [Unicode 6.3].</p> 
            
            <p>As a Root Zone LGR, the repertoire includes neither digits nor the HYPHEN-MINUS.</p>
             
            <p>For further details, see Section 3.2.1, "Repertoire" in [LGR-3].</p> 
            
            <p>Each code point or range is tagged with the script or scripts that the code point is used with, and 
            a reference to the Unicode Standard in which the code point was first encoded, see "References" below.
            Some code points are also tagged with script-specific classifications. These tags have been prefixed
            with the Unicode script identifier.</p>

            <h2>Variants</h2>

            <p>The variant mappings in this LGR are the union of the non-reflexive variant mappings from all the Element LGRs
            that have been integrated into this version of the Root Zone LGR. Because the
            disposition of variant labels, for example as "allocatable", is specific to each script, information related to that cannot be
            expressed in the script-neutral context of this merged file. Instead, all merged variant mappings are
            labeled as "blocked" in this document as needed for conflict checking. See also Section 3.2.2, "Variants" in [LGR-3].</p>
            
            <p>Context Rules for Variants: some of the variants defined in this LGR are "effective null variants", that is,
            some code points in the source map to "nothing" in the target with all other code points unchanged.
            (Because mappings are symmetric, it does not matter whether it is the forward or reverse mapping that
            maps to "null"). Such variants require a context rule to keep the variant set well behaved. Symmetry requires
            the same context rule for both forward and reverse mappings.</p>

            <p>In other cases, the sequences or code points making up source and target are constrained by explicit
            context rules on the code points (or by implicit context rules defined for the adjacent code points). 
            In such a case, any variants may require context rules that match the intersection
            between the effective contexts for both source and target; otherwise, a sequence might be considered valid in some
            variant label when it would not be valid in an equivalent context in an original label.</p>

            <p>The specification of variants in the Root Zone LGR follows the guidelines in [RFC 8228].</p>

            <h2>Character Classes</h2>

            <p>This merged LGR includes the cumulative set of character classes from all the Element LGRs
            that have been integrated into this version of the Root Zone LGR. See Section 3.2.3, "Character Classes" in [LGR-3].
            The names for any script-specific character classes have been prefixed with the Unicode script identifier.</p>

            <h2>Whole Label Evaluation (WLE) and Context Rules</h2>
            <p>This merged LGR includes the cumulative set of WLE and contextrules and actions from all the Element LGRs
            that have been integrated into this version of the Root Zone LGR. See Section 3.2.4, "Whole Label EvaluationRules (WLE)"
             [LGR-3]. See also the comments given for each rule or action. </p> 
            
            <h3>Default Whole Label Evaluation Rules and Actions</h3> 
            <p>The integrated LGR includes the set of required default WLE rules and actions applicable to the Root Zone 
            and defined in [MSR-4]. They are marked with &#x235F;. These default rules include the restrictions defined in
            [RFC 5891] on placement of combining marks.</p> 
            
            <h3>Script-specific WLE rules</h3>
            <p>The names for any script-specific rules have been prefixed with the Unicode script identifier.</p>
            
            <h2>Methodology and Contributors</h2>

            <p>The Root Zone Label Generation Rules - LGR-3 [LGR-3] were integrated by the Integration Panel [IP], 
            from a set of proposals for script-based root zone LGRs developed by community-based Generation 
            Panels [GPs] in an open process with multiple public consultations defined in [Procedure] and [Guidelines]. 
            For more information on the methodology and contributors, see [LGR-3], in particular Section 2 "Process of Integration" 
            and Section 8, "Contributors".</p>
