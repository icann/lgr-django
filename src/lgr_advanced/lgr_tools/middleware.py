    Simple middleware that takes care of UnicodeDecodeError.

    When a UnicodeDecodeError is thrown, this middleware will intercept it, add a message to notify
    the user to ensure its file(s) is/are correctly encoded, and will try to redirect them on the page they were.
    For the last part, we use the HTTP_REFERER. This might be a bit simplistic, but seems to work fine for now.
